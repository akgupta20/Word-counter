        Technologies are artifacts made through a systematic application of
        knowledge and used to reach practical goals. They are widely
        used in medicine, science, industry, communication, transportation, and
        daily life. Technologies include physical objects like utensils or
        machines, as well as intangible tools like software. Many technological
        advancements have led to societal changes. The earliest known technology
        is the stone tool, used in the prehistoric era,[3] followed by fire use,
        which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development
        of language in the Ice Age.[4] The invention of the wheel in the Bronze
        Age enabled wider travel and the creation of more complex machines.[5]
        Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the
        telephone, and the Internet have lowered communication barriers and
        ushered in the knowledge economy. While technology contributes to
        economic development and human prosperity, it can also have negative
        impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or cause social harms like
        technological unemployment caused by automation.[6] As a result,
        philosophical and political debates have arisen over the role and use of
        technology, the ethics of technology, and the mitigation of technology's
        potential downsides.[7] Historical and contemporary movements like
        neo-Luddism and anarcho-primitivism criticize technology's
        pervasiveness,[8] while adherents to transhumanism and
        techno-progressivism actively support technological change, viewing it
        as emancipatory.[9] Many negative impacts of technology can be mitigated
        through technological innovations like renewable energy in
        transportation and industry,[10] genetically modified crops to address
        soil depletion,[11] and space exploration to mitigate global
        catastrophic risks.[12]
